Demonstrates understanding of: flexbox, positioning, the box model in CSS

Demonstrated proper communication techniques and the proper use of Git

Frontend: 
Student incorporated functional components in Jsx to add dynamic functionality to the app using React Hooks; useState, useEffect, on change handler in form 
Management. Working with form data using form submit, possibly implementing Formik.
Student incorporates the ability to get information by use of an API documentation; 
Axios, Fetch.
Student’s final product is easy to read, well organized by use of CSS and stylized components.  



Student's code was organized at the component level, proper usage of state and props are demonstrated throughout the project, the UI is composed of small reusable components, proper usage of useState and useEffect hooks are clearly incorporated and correctly implemented.
 
Student implemented Read operations using either Axios or Fetch to display 3rd party data on page. Route management properly installed and used to show top level pages as well as nested views where necessary. Data displayed on page is properly laid out in a modern easy to interpret fashion. Seamless integration of UI static landing page now incorporated.

Answer Career specific questions :  
Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
Bootstrap, Reactstrap
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
No - it is a file that is given to us via Github
- Are you required to pay to use the API?
No payment required.
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
We have not considered using an Apple Framework.
For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
People in need of help with answers to specific problems
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
The people polled said this would be a very useful app, and would consider paying for the service.
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Online informal interviews based on those creating the site.
Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
